/**
 * Problem 1: Spiral Matrix Traversal
 * 
 * Write a function that takes an m x n matrix as input and returns all elements of the
 * matrix in spiral order (clockwise, starting from top left).
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: [
 *  [1, 2, 3],
 *  [4, 5, 6],
 *  [7, 8, 9]
 * ]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
 */

/**
 * Problem 2: Generate Spiral Matrix
 * 
 * Write a function that takes a positive integer n and generates an n x n matrix
 * filled with elements from 1 to nÂ² in spiral order (clockwise, starting from top left).
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: [
 *  [1, 2, 3],
 *  [8, 9, 4],
 *  [7, 6, 5]
 * ]

/**
 * Problem 3: Spiral Matrix III
 * 
 * You start at the position (r0, c0) in an infinite 2D grid. From there, you need to
 * fill a given R x C matrix in a clockwise spiral order, moving outward from the starting position.
 * Return the coordinates visited in order.
 * 
 * The coordinates should be returned as an array of [row, col] pairs.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: R = 5, C = 6, r0 = 1, c0 = 4
 * Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],...] (truncated for brevity)
